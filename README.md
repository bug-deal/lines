lines

Graphical effect resulting from the layered artifacts of alternating black and white aliased lines drawn from an origin point to the screen edges.

I remember encountering this effect in some Apple ][ program, but I don’t remember the details.

Now that we’re in the future and it’s easy to draw all those lines very quickly, I’m looking at how it changes as the origin slowly moves.

This is a [LÖVE] [1] project. I was learning LÖVE and Lua at the same time I was implementing this, so that’s my excuse for for the confused style.
